    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic croque madame makes the perfect French-inspired brunch or lunch dish. </p>
    <p>Once you try this, it will be hard to have "just" a ham and cheese sandwich again.</p>
    <p>Don't cheat and use Swiss cheese, this deserves the real thing! Using Gruyère cheese will make all the difference.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons salted butter, softened, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 ounces shredded Gruyère cheese</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>4 slices white bread, lightly toasted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until slightly brown, about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. </li>
        <li>Spread about 1 teaspoon butter on 2 pieces of bread. Spread 1 tablespoon cheese sauce on top and layer each with a ham slice. </li>
        <li>Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is almost melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the oven, place toast slices together to make 2 sandwiches and pour remaining cheese sauce on top of each sandwich.</li>
        <li>While the sandwiches are broiling, heat remaining butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Top each sandwich with an egg and sprinkle with dill, if using. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
